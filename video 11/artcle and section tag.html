        <p>Fashion is a vibrant form of self-expression that reflects culture and individuality. It evolves with trends,
            influenced by designers, celebrities, and social media. Fashion promotes creativity while embracing
            inclusivity and diversity, representing various identities and body types, and serves as a powerful medium
            for social change and cultural dialogue.</p>
